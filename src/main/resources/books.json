The Pythons John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam are increasingly recognized and honored for their creativity and enduring influence in the worlds of comedy and film. Monty Python and Philosophy extends that recognition into the world of philosophy. Fifteen experts in topics like mythology, Buddhism, feminism, logic, ethics, and the philosophy of science bring their expertise to bear on Python movies such as Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian and Flying Circus mainstays such as the Argument Clinic, the Dead Parrot Sketch, and, of course, the Bruces, the Pythons\u2019 demented, song-filled vision of an Australian philosophy department. Monty Python and Philosophy follows the same hit format as the other titles in this popular series and explains all the philosophical concepts discussed in laymen\u2019s terms.",

    "description": "Python Algorithms explains the Python approach to algorithm analysis and design. Written by Magnus Lie Hetland, author of Beginning Python, this book is sharply focused on classical algorithms, but it also gives a solid understanding of fundamental algorithmic problem-solving techniques. The book deals with some of the most important and challenging areas of programming and computer science, but in a highly pedagogic and readable manner. The book covers both algorithmic theory and programming practice, demonstrating how theory is reflected in real Python programs. Well-known algorithms and data structures that are built into the Python language are explained, and the user is shown how to implement and evaluate others himself. What you\u2019ll learn Transform new problems to well-known algorithmic problems with efficient solutions, or show that the problems belong to classes of problems thought not to be efficiently solvable. Analyze algorithms and Python programs both using mathematical tools and basic experiments and benchmarks. Prove correctness, optimality, or bounds on approximation error for Python programs and their underlying algorithms. Understand several classical algorithms and data structures in depth, and be able to implement these efficiently in Python. Design and implement new algorithms for new problems, using time-tested design principles and techniques. Speed up implementations, using a plethora of tools for high-performance computing in Python. Who this book is for The book is intended for Python programmers who need to learn about algorithmic problem-solving, or who need a refresher. Students of computer science, or similar programming-related topics, such as bioinformatics, may also find the book to be quite useful.

In Beyond Java, Bruce chronicles the rise of the most successful language of all time, and then lays out, in painstaking detail, the compromises the founders had to make to establish success. Then, he describes the characteristics of likely successors to Java. He builds to a rapid and heady climax, presenting alternative languages and frameworks with productivity and innovation unmatched in Java. He closes with an evaluation of the most popular and important programming languages, and their future role in a world beyond Java. If you are agree with the book's premise--that Java's reign is coming to an end--then this book will help you start to build your skills accordingly. You can download some of the frameworks discussed and learn a few new languages. This book will teach you what a new language needs to succeed, so when things do change, you'll be more prepared.

    "description": "The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.",

    "description": "Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice , the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant. This book covers: Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent Performance optimization dos and don'ts Testing concurrent programs Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model",

    "description": "With remarkable scope and in scrupulous detail, Professor Anderson analyzes the Indonesian revolution of 1945. Against the background of Javanese culture and the Japanese occupation, he explores the origins of the revolutionary youth groups, the military, and the political parties to challenge conventional interpretations of revolutionary movements in Asia. The author emphasizes that the critical role in the outbreak was played not by the dissatisfied intellectuals or by an oppressed working class but by the youth of Indonesia. Perhaps most important are the insights he offers into the conflict between strategies for seeking national revolution and those for attaining social change. By giving first priority to gaining recognition of Indonesian sovereignty from the outside world, he argues, the revolutionary leadership had to adopt conservative domestic policies that greatly reduced the possibility of far-reaching social reform. This in-depth study of the independence crisis in Indonesia, brought back to life by Equinox Publishing as the first title in it's Classic Indonesia series, also illuminates the revolutionary process in other nations, where wars for independence have been fought but significant social and economic progress has not yet been achieved. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Benedict Anderson is one of the world's leading authorities on South East Asian nationalism and particularly on Indonesia. He is Professor of International Studies and Director of the Modern Indonesia Project at Cornell University, New York. His other works include Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism and The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World.",

What You Will Learn Explore the tools and frameworks required for effective TDD development Perform the Red-Green-Refactor process efficiently, the pillar around which all other TDD procedures are based Master effective unit testing in isolation from the rest of your code Design simple and easily maintainable codes by implementing different techniques Use mocking frameworks and techniques to easily write and quickly execute tests Develop an application to implement behaviour-driven development in conjunction with unit testing Enable and disable features using Feature Toggles In Detail Test-driven development (TDD) is a development approach that relies on a test-first procedure that emphasises writing a test before writing the necessary code, and then refactoring the code to optimize it. The value of performing TDD with Java, one of the most established programming languages, is to improve the productivity of programmers, the maintainability and performance of code, and develop a deeper understanding of the language and how to employ it effectively. Starting with the basics of TDD and reasons why its adoption is beneficial, this book will take you from the first steps of TDD with Java until you are confident enough to embrace the practice in your day-to-day routine. You'll be guided through setting up tools, frameworks, and the environment you need, and will dive right in to hands-on exercises with the goal of mastering one practice, tool, or framework at a time. You'll learn about the Red-Green-Refactor procedure, how to write unit tests, and how to use them as executable documentation. With this book you'll also discover how to design simple and easily maintainable code, work with mocks, utilise behaviour-driven development, refactor old legacy code, and release a half-finished feature to production with feature toggles. You will finish this book with a deep understanding of the test-driven development methodology and the confidence to apply it to application programming with Java. Style and approach An easy-to-follow, hands-on guide to building applications through effective coding practices. This book covers practical examples by introducing different problems, each one designed as a learning exercise to help you understand each aspect of TDD.",

If you are interested in the nature of computation and curious about the very idea behind object orientation, this book is for you. This book will engage your brain (if not your tummy). Through its sparkling interactive style, you will learn about three essential OO concepts: interfaces, visitors, and factories. A refreshing change from the 'yet another Java book' phenomenon. Every serious Java programmer should own a copy.' -- Gary McGraw, Ph.D., Research Scientist at Reliable Software Technologies and coauthor of Java Security Java is a new object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems for programming the Internet and intelligent appliances. In a very short time it has become one of the most widely used programming languages for education as well as commercial applications. Design patterns, which have moved object-oriented programming to a new level, provide programmers with a language to communicate with others about their designs. As a result, programs become more readable, more reusable, and more easily extensible. In this book, Matthias Felleisen and Daniel Friedman use a small subset of Java to introduce pattern-directed program design. With their usual clarity and flair, they gently guide readers through the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and pattern-based design. Readers new to programming, as well as those with some background, will enjoy their learning experience as they work their way through Felleisen and Friedman's dialogue. src='/graphics/yellowball.gif' href='/books/FELTP/Java-fm.html'Foreword and Preface",

    "description": "Introduction to Cryptography with Java Applets covers the mathematical basis of cryptography and cryptanalysis, like linear diophantine equations, linear congruences, systems of linear congruences, quadratic congruences, and exponential congruences. The chapters present theorems and proofs, and many mathematical examples.Cryptography with Java Applets also covers programming ciphers and cryptanalytic attacks on ciphers. In addition many other types of cryptographic applications, like digest functions, shadows, database encryption, message signing, establishing keys, large integer arithmetic, pseudo-random bit generation, and authentication are included. The author has developed various Java crypto classes to perform these functions, and many programming exercises are assigned to the reader. The reader should be someone with a basic working knowledge of Java, but knowledge of number theory or cryptography is not necessary. What sets this Introduction to Cyrptography with Java Applets apart from other crypto books is the level of interactivity with the reader. There are many Java applets on the World Wide Web that students can run from their computers to see various ciphers and other crypto concepts at work. They do not need a Java compiler or interpreter to do this, just an Internet connection.",

    "description": "Because of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code. The book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.",

We begin by outlining the many advantages of its multi-threaded operation over the pooled JVM function of earlier releases. The Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) is described and we highlight the benefits OSGi brings to both development and deployment. Details are then provided about how to configure and use the new JVM server environment. Examples are included of the deployment process, which takes a Java application from the workstation Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) with the IBM CICS Explorer\u00ae software development kit (SDK) plug-in, through the various stages up to execution in a stand-alone CICS region and an IBM CICSPlex\u00ae environment. The book continues with a comparison between traditional CICS programming, and CICS programming from Java. As a result, the main functional areas of the Java class library for CICS (JCICS) application programming interface (API) are extensively reviewed. Further chapters are provided to demonstrate interaction with structured data such as copybooks, and how to access relational databases by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Structured Query Language for Java (SQLJ). Finally, we devote a chapter to the migration of applications from the pooled JVM model to the new JVM server run time.",

The older catalogues of collections of Indonesian manuscripts (Javanese, Malay, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese), which were written in Dutch, did not offer such additional aids to interested readers. One of the reasons was. , that the authors (Vreede, Brandes, van Ronkel, Juynboll, Berg) presupposed a certain knowledge of the Indones,ian peoples, their countries and their culture with Dutch students. As often as not the latter, or their families, had lived for many years in Java, and they were destined, when they had completed their studies in The Netherlands, to pass one or more decades of 'their active life in the ,tropics in the service of Government, the Christian Missions or the Bible Society. The Archipelago was their second home country. Some familiarity with things Indonesian was found in several circles of society in The Netherlands before the second world war, and information (though not always scholarly and exact) was supplied by quite a number of books and periodicals.

    "description": "The growing interest in the history of Indonesia has made it desirable to have an English summary of the principal works of the Dutch historian Dr H. J. de Graaf, who in several books and articles published between 1935 and 1973 has given a description of the development of the Javanese kingdom of Mataram, based both on European and in digenous material. His works form a substantial contribution to the study of the national history of Indonesia. The Summary contains references to the paragraphs of the Dutch books and articles. This makes it easy for those readers who have a know ledge of Dutch to consult the original texts. The List of Sources for the study of Javanese history from 1500 to 1700 is composed of the lists in the summarized books and articles, and the Index of Names refers not only to the present Summary but also to the eight original texts. Many names of persons and localities in the Index have been provided with short explanatory notes and references to other lemmata as a quick way to give some provisional information on Javanese history.",

    "description": "Developed by Jean-Paul Benz\u00e9rci more than 30 years ago, correspondence analysis as a framework for analyzing data quickly found widespread popularity in Europe. The topicality and importance of correspondence analysis continue, and with the tremendous computing power now available and new fields of application emerging, its significance is greater than ever. Correspondence Analysis and Data Coding with Java and R clearly demonstrates why this technique remains important and in the eyes of many, unsurpassed as an analysis framework. After presenting some historical background, the author presents a theoretical overview of the mathematics and underlying algorithms of correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The focus then shifts to data coding, with a survey of the widely varied possibilities correspondence analysis offers and introduction of the Java software for correspondence analysis, clustering, and interpretation tools. A chapter of case studies follows, wherein the author explores applications to areas such as shape analysis and time-evolving data. The final chapter reviews the wealth of studies on textual content as well as textual form, carried out by Benz\u00e9cri and his research lab. These discussions show the importance of correspondence analysis to artificial intelligence as well as to stylometry and other fields. This book not only shows why correspondence analysis is important, but with a clear presentation replete with advice and guidance, also shows how to put this technique into practice. Downloadable software and data sets allow quick, hands-on exploration of innovative correspondence analysis applications.",

    "description": "Eating Spring Rice is the first major ethnographic study of HIV/AIDS in China. Drawing on more than a decade of ethnographic research (1995-2005), primarily in Yunnan Province, Sandra Teresa Hyde chronicles the rise of the HIV epidemic from the years prior to the Chinese government's acknowledgement of this public health crisis to post-reform thinking about infectious-disease management. Hyde combines innovative public health research with in-depth ethnography on the ways minorities and sex workers were marked as the principle carriers of HIV, often despite evidence to the contrary. Hyde approaches HIV/AIDS as a study of the conceptualization and the circulation of a disease across boundaries that requires different kinds of anthropological thinking and methods. She focuses on \"everyday AIDS practices\" to examine the links between the material and the discursive representations of HIV/AIDS. This book illustrates how representatives of the Chinese government singled out a former kingdom of Thailand, Sipsongpanna, and its indigenous ethnic group, the Tai-L\u00fce, as carriers of HIV due to a history of prejudice and stigma, and to the geography of the borderlands. Hyde poses questions about the cultural politics of epidemics, state-society relations, Han and non-Han ethnic dynamics, and the rise of an AIDS public health bureaucracy in the post-reform era.",

The area was first settled in the 1850s by pioneers like James Smith, who, inspired by the landscape, named the place Spring Grove. Smith was followed by the likes of \"Big\" Ole Gulbransgutton, who chased crooked land surveyors out of town with his bare fist; by the innovative Mons Fladager, whose business acumen earned him the title of \"Father of Spring Grove\"; and by the 20th-century cartoonist Peter J.

Fifteen major league clubs offered him a contract, but it was the Milwaukee Braves who won out, signing Jordan to a $45,000 bonus\u2014one of the largest paid to any new player by the organization\u2014and shipping him off to McCook, Nebraska, to play for their Class D ball club. It did not take long, however, for Jordan to realize he was out of his depth in professional baseball\u2019s backwoods. He battled with inconsistency and a lack of control for three dismal seasons in such far-flung locales as Keokuk, Iowa, and Palatka, Florida, before the Braves released him and he gave up his dreams of big league greatness. Declared \u201cunforgettable\u201d by the Los Angeles Times and \u201ca major triumph\u201d by the Philadelphia Inquirer, A False Spring is a powerful and deeply affecting memoir about the gift of athletic talent and the heartbreak of unfulfilled promise.",

It has proven to be an exciting opportunity for Claire but now she's facing the end of her first academic year with a measure of melancholy. Not only is the spring production about to end but her student and clandestine lover, Tanner Griffin, is about to leave school for Hollywood. The person responsible - renowned producer Spencer Wallace - spotted Tanner in an earlier school stage production and signed him to a role in his next film, Photo Flash. Now with the closing performance of the spring production completed, the cast party at Claire's house promises to be a bittersweet affair. What Claire gets, however, is more than she bargained for when, in the middle of the very crowded affair, Spencer Wallace turns up dead in Claire's pool. To make it worse, Claire herself is one of the most probable suspects - with means, motive, and opportunity to have committed the deed. But Wallace is a man with a past and a reputation - and there are far more than a handful of people with better reasons to wish him harm. Now, with time running short, it falls to Claire to figure out who is really responsible before someone else gets away with the crime and leaves her holding the bag.",

The emperor of the Khaiem tries to form a marriage alliance between his son and the daughter of a Galtic lord, hoping the Khaiem men and Galtic women will produce a new generation to help create a peaceful future.

    "description": "A beautiful and nostalgic look at the royal tour that captured a generation -- the first visit of a reigning monarch to Canada. This six week visit from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back again (with a short excursion to the United States) enthralled a young nation. Fifty years ago, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth arrived at Quebec City to tour \"the senior daughter of the dominions\". This is a fond recollection of those few magic weeks and the outpouring of affection for the new king and his beautiful wife. Filled with contemporary pictures and anecdotes, this book captures the feeling of the times with a look at the way Canadians reacted to seeing their sovereign: the formal and informal photographs, the speeches and tributes, the advertising art, the menus for formal dinners, the music and poetry composed for the event. The second section of the book chronicles the King and Queen's other visits to Canada before and after that epochal visit. The King was here as a young man. The Queen Mother has been to Canada many times since 1939, and in a moving speech at Queen's Park in Toronto in 1979 reflecting on the tour she said \"I lost my heart to Canada and Canadians....\" Royal Spring includes an 8-page section on the most recent and golden anniversary visit -- July 1989.",

It happened at night in the summer of 1966, when my elementary school headmaster hanged himself. In 1966 Moying, a student at a prestigious language school in Beijing, seems destined for a promising future. Everything changes when student Red Guards begin to orchestrate brutal assaults, violent public humiliations, and forced confessions. After watching her teachers and headmasters beaten in public, Moying flees school for the safety of home, only to witness her beloved grandmother denounced, her home ransacked, her father's precious books flung onto the back of a truck, and Baba himself taken away. From labor camp, Baba entrusts a friend to deliver a reading list of banned books to Moying so that she can continue to learn. Now, with so much of her life at risk, she finds sanctuary in the world of imagination and learning.

A nature writer and avid birder offers a portrait of a season in the heartland of North America as he and his wife travel through the country and share stories of all that they encounter: people putting their lives back in place after a tornado, volunteers giving their time to conservation efforts, and the drive of all species to move their genes to the next generation, which manifests itself so abundantly in spring. \u201cTheir journey begins in New Jersey and continues to Nebraska, their arrival timed to witness the annual migration of half a million northbound sandhill cranes. Next come Colorado and a primer on how homesteading sodbusters transformed an ocean of vibrant prairie grasses into a devastating dustbowl; New Mexico and the Sixth Annual High Plains Lesser Prairie-Chicken Festival; back through Colorado and the Pawnee National Grasslands for a glimpse of the threatened prairie dog, once (along with bison) among the environmental engineers of the 19th century Western plains; and into South Dakota, home to between 800 and 1,400 free-ranging bison.

    "description": "The Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu) is a chronicle kept by the dukes of the state of Lu from 722 to 481 B.C.E. Luxuriant Gems of the \"Spring and Autumn\" (Chunqiu fanlu) follows the interpretations of the Gongyang Commentary, whose transmitters sought to explicate the special language of the Spring and Autumn. The work is often ascribed to the Han scholar and court official Dong Zhongshu, but, as this study reveals, the text is in fact a compendium of writings by a variety of authors spanning several generations. It depicts a utopian vision of a flourishing humanity that they believed to be Confucius's legacy to the world. The Gongyang masters thought that Confucius had written the Spring and Autumn, employing subtle phrasing to indicate approval or disapproval of important events and personages. Luxuriant Gems therefore augments Confucian ethical and philosophical teachings with chapters on cosmology, statecraft, and other topics drawn from contemporary non-Confucian traditions. A major resource, this book features the first complete English-language translation of Luxuriant Gems, divided into eight thematic sections with introductions that address dating, authorship, authenticity, and the relationship between the Spring and Autumn and the Gongyang approach. Critically illuminating early Chinese philosophy, religion, literature, and politics, this book conveys the brilliance of intellectual life in the Han dynasty during the formative decades of the Chinese imperial state.",

    "description": "From an award-winning journalist, a brave and necessary immersion into the everyday struggles of Palestinian life Over the past three years, American writer Ben Ehrenreich has been traveling to and living in the West Bank, staying with Palestinian families in its largest cities and its smallest villages. Along the way he has written major stories for American outlets, including a remarkable New York Times Magazine cover story. Now comes the powerful new work that has always been his ultimate goal, The Way to the Spring. We are familiar with brave journalists who travel to bleak or war-torn places on a mission to listen and understand, to gather the stories of people suffering from extremes of oppression and want: Katherine Boo, Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, Ted Conover, and Philip Gourevitch among them. Palestine is, by any measure, whatever one's politics, one such place. Ruled by the Israeli military, set upon and harassed constantly by Israeli settlers who admit unapologetically to wanting to drive them from the land, forced to negotiate an ever more elaborate and more suffocating series of fences, checkpoints, and barriers that have sundered home from field, home from home, this is a population whose living conditions are unique, and indeed hard to imagine. In a great act of bravery, empathy and understanding, Ben Ehrenreich, by placing us in the footsteps of ordinary Palestinians and telling their story with surpassing literary power and grace, makes it impossible for us to turn away.",

    "description": "The lunacy of the final months of World War II, as experienced by a young German soldier Distant, silent, often drunk, Walter Urban is a difficult man to have as a father. But his son\u2014the narrator of this slim, harrowing novel\u2014is curious about Walter\u2019s experiences during World War II, and so makes him a present of a blank notebook in which to write down his memories. Walter dies, however, leaving nothing but the barest skeleton of a story on those pages, leading his son to fill in the gaps himself, rightly or wrongly, with what he can piece together of his father\u2019s early life. This, then, is the story of Walter and his dangerously outspoken friend Friedrich Caroli, seventeen-year-old trainee milkers on a dairy farm in northern Germany who are tricked into volunteering for the army during the spring of 1945: the last, and in many ways the worst, months of the war. The men are driven to the point of madness by what they experience, and when Friedrich finally deserts his post, Walter is forced to do the unthinkable. Told in a remarkable impressionistic voice, focusing on the tiny details and moments of grotesque beauty that flower even in the most desperate situations, Ralf Rothmann\u2019s To Die in Spring \u201cushers in the post\u2013[G\u00fcnter] Grass era with enormous power\u201d (Die Zeit).",

    "author": "Chad Montrie",
    "description": "Since its publication in 1962, Rachel Carson\u2019s book Silent Spring has often been celebrated as the catalyst that sparked an American environmental movement. Yet environmental consciousness and environmental protest in some regions of the United States date back to the nineteenth century, with the advent of industrial manufacturing and the consequent growth of cities. As these changes transformed people's lives, ordinary Americans came to recognize the connections between economic exploitation, social inequality, and environmental problems. As the modern age dawned, they turned to labor unions, sportsmen\u2019s clubs, racial and ethnic organizations, and community groups to respond to such threats accordingly. The Myth of Silent Spring tells this story. By challenging the canonical \u201csongbirds and suburbs\u201d interpretation associated with Carson and her work, the book gives readers a more accurate sense of the past and better prepares them for thinking and acting in the present.",

    "description": "WHY IS IT THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF LITERATURE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY WRITERS IN THE GRIP OF ALCOHOLISM, AN ADDICTION THAT COST THEM PERSONAL HAPPINESS AND CAUSED HARM TO THOSE WHO LOVED THEM? In The Trip to Echo Spring, Olivia Laing examines the link between creativity and alcohol through the work and lives of six extraordinary men: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, John Berryman, John Cheever, and Raymond Carver. All six of these writers were alcoholics, and the subject of drinking surfaces in some of their finest work, from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to A Moveable Feast. Often, they did their drinking together: Hemingway and Fitzgerald ricocheting through the caf\u00e9s of Paris in the 1920s; Carver and Cheever speeding to the liquor store in Iowa in the icy winter of 1973. Olivia Laing grew up in an alcoholic family herself. One spring, wanting to make sense of this ferocious, entangling disease, she took a journey across America that plunged her into the heart of these overlapping lives. As she travels from Cheever's New York to Williams's New Orleans, and from Hemingway's Key West to Carver's Port Angeles, she pieces together a topographical map of alcoholism, from the horrors of addiction to the miraculous possibilities of recovery. Beautiful, captivating, and original, The Trip to Echo Spring strips away the myth of the alcoholic writer to reveal the terrible price creativity can exert.",

You will read amazing stories of the child that was trapped in the communist system. Being constantly persecuted by the authorities, this child (\"this child\" refers to me) was searching for answers on how to escape from the country that took away childhood from Christian children like me. When I was growing up, the desire to fight back never faded away from my mind. On the contrary, it was getting stronger. The day had come when I became a soldier in Christ (at the age of thirteen), standing for my beliefs and fighting for my Christian rights and religious freedom within the \"jaws of the red dragon\". Part II of the book, \" New World\", is about me living in the U.S. it tells you about the exciting landing in New York and all the emotional moments of tasting the freedom. The first sight that I saw was the Statue of Liberty. It felt like the statue was talking to me... \"Give me your tired, your poor...\" large drops of tears rolled down my cheeks. It wasn''t a dream anymore, it was a real free world! Part II will tell you about my achievements and failures, my happy moments and tragedies, my romantic love and marriage. You will learn how God works everything for good for those who love him. This deeply emotional and full of miracles testimony will touch your heart and will open a window into the world that you never saw before.",

    "description": "This volume examines the role of Arab women in Arab Spring and their contribution to the ongoing process of change sweeping the region. The book begins with an examination of the process of democratization and its impediments in the Arab World since the Second World War. It then looks at the conditions that led to the upsurge of the so-called Arab Spring. Finally, it underscores women\u2019s role as participants, organizers, leaders, but also as victims. The main thesis of the book is that while Arab women were an integral part of the revolutionary efforts within the Arab Spring paradigm, they did not benefit from their sacrifices. Although they continue to be part of the process of change, their gains, rights and scope for participation are still limited. If the expansion of women\u2019s participation and the scope of their rights do not seem to be a priority for revolutionary forces, women have made remarkable achievements, especially in some Arab Spring countries such as Yemen and Libya. The book includes case studies of some Arab Spring countries and other countries influenced by developments: Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Yemen, Algeria, Jordan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. It calls on revolutionary and reformist forces to give special attention to issues related to Arab women, as they are an indispensable pillar in the process of reform, development, peace and stability in the Middle East.",

The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. For three days battle has raged in the snow around the great city of Tar Valon. In the city, a Foretelling of the future is uttered.

    "description": "Since development first began on Spring in 2003, there's been a constant buzz about it in Java development publications and corporate IT departments. The reason is clear: Spring is a lightweight Java framework in a world of complex heavyweight architectures that take forever to implement. Spring is like a breath of fresh air to overworked developers.In Spring, you can make an object secure, remote, or transactional, with a couple of lines of configuration instead of embedded code. The resulting application is simple and clean. In Spring, you can work less and go home early, because you can strip away a whole lot of the redundant code that you tend to see in most J2EE applications. You won't be nearly as burdened with meaningless detail. In Spring, you can change your mind without the consequences bleeding through your entire application. You'll adapt much more quickly than you ever could before.Spring: A Developer's Notebook offers a quick dive into the new Spring framework, designed to let you get hands-on as quickly as you like. If you don't want to bother with a lot of theory, this book is definitely for you. You'll work through one example after another. Along the way, you'll discover the energy and promise of the Spring framework.This practical guide features ten code-intensive labs that'll rapidly get you up to speed. You'll learn how to do the following, and more: install the Spring Framework set up the development environment use Spring with other open source Java tools such as Tomcat, Struts, and Hibernate master AOP and transactions utilize ORM solutions As with all titles in the Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips all the boring prose and cuts right to the chase. It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through one instructional example after another-examples that speak to you instead of at you.",

He had passed the whole evening in the company of charming ladies and cultivated men; some of the ladies were beautiful, almost all the men were distinguished by intellect or talent; he himself had talked with great success, even with brilliance and, for all that, never yet had the taedium vitae of which the Romans talked of old, the 'disgust for life,' taken hold of him with such irresistible, such suffocating force. Had he been a little younger, he would have cried with misery, weariness, and exasperation: a biting, burning bitterness, like the bitter of wormwood, filled his whole soul. A sort of clinging repugnance, a weight of loathing closed in upon him on all sides like a dark night of autumn; and he did not know how to get free from this darkness, this bitterness. Sleep it was useless to reckon upon; he knew he should not sleep. He fell to thinking slowly, listlessly, wrathfully. He thought of the vanity, the uselessness, the vulgar falsity of all things human. All the stages of man's life passed in order before his mental gaze (he had himself lately reached his fifty-second year), and not one found grace in his eyes. Everywhere the same ever-lasting pouring of water into a sieve, the ever-lasting beating of the air, everywhere the same self-deception half in good faith, half conscious any toy to amuse the child, so long as it keeps him from crying. And then, all of a sudden, old age drops down like snow on the head, and with it the ever-growing, ever-gnawing, and devouring dread of death and the plunge into the abyss!",

Now she faces an impossible choice between the music in her heart and the traditions branded upon her soul. Mike Trueherz is a dedicated young paramedic who finds a kindred spirit in Sadie. Torn between family duty and his desire to pursue a life beyond his father\u2019s rural medical practice, he is inspired by Sadie\u2019s honesty and courage. While spring unfurls rich colors and bounty through the countryside of Lancaster County, Sadie and Mike must reconcile their families\u2019 expectations with their own callings. Ultimately, their faith in each other and the God that has brought them together will give them the strength and the peace to take a chance\u2014and to make the biggest decision of their lives. A coming-of-age story reflecting the deepest messages of love, A Simple Spring is music for the heart.",

    "description": "Omar Sabree was born and raised in the city of Norfolk Virginia to father Elzie Lee Simms and mother Mary Ann Pittman. His mother Mary raised him as a single parent and named him at birth, Julius Cornell Pittman. He was known affectionately as \"Block\" or by his middle name Cornell. The name Omar Abubakir Sabree was partially chosen and partially bestowed upon him after accepting Islamism as his faith, and Islam as his religion. Omar attended Diggs Park Elementary, Campostella Jr. High, and Granby High Schools. After which he enlisted in the Navy and later went on to become a Merchant Seaman. In October of 1980, Omar married his childhood sweetheart. She was affectionately known as Brenda from the Diggs Park projects. After also accepting Islam, Brenda became Khadijah Foye Sabree. Omar was arrested and incarcerated on February 9, 1981, charged with murder, abduction, burglary and robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to life plus seventy years on April 13, 1982. From that day on, Omar decided to record some of the events that were about to take place in his life. \"500 Spring Street\" was the address of the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond. What follows behind this title are the prison journals of Omar Sabree.",

    "description": "\"No one creates so many memorable, saucy aphorisms-piquant, bitter-sweet, arousing.\" -Pat C. Hoy II, New York University Sam Pickering's essays are funny and wise-and always intoxicating, eggnog to warm glazed winter nights and juleps to cool sweltering summer days. He wanders Connecticut, Canada, and the South, seeding his old farm in Nova Scotia with words and scattering paragraphs in and about classrooms at the University of Connecticut. He describes the great flowerings of summers and falls. He mulls over vanishing friendships, then hunts for buried treasure in a library. He endures a massage, ponders the genteel, and explores shadowy alcoves and books. For him home is where heart and heartache thrive together. Students make him laugh and weep, and in part his book is a teaching manual crammed with anecdotal good sense. He buries his old dog George and picks up Bert, a rescue dachshund addicted to unmentionable munchies and cloddish doggy behavior, an animal who obstinately refuses to cross the Rainbow Bridge. Pickering runs road races, although he says anyone in a motorized walker could leave him far behind. In \"Premortem\" he anatomizes his vanishing muscles and then decides to have a knee operation in hopes of shuffling fast enough to keep a heeltap ahead of the pale rider on the white horse. This is a book about love and happiness-a restorative collection that shows readers how to enjoy life's small glories even among its indignities. When the going gets sour, Pickering tells a joke and transforms the sour into sweet delight. Sam Pickering teaches English at the University of Connecticut. The inspiration for the teacher in the movie Dead Poets Society, Pickering is a member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers and a master of the essay form. Among his dozen collections of essays are A Little Fling and The Last Book, both published by the University of Tennessee Press.",

You'll learn how to bypass the tedious configuration steps so that you can concentrate on your application's behavior. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the TechnologyThe Spring Framework simplifies enterprise Java development, but it does require lots of tedious configuration work. Spring Boot radically streamlines spinning up a Spring application. You get automatic configuration and a model with established conventions for build-time and runtime dependencies. You also get a handy command-line interface you can use to write scripts in Groovy. Developers who use Spring Boot often say that they can't imagine going back to hand configuring their applications. About the Book \"Spring Boot in Action\" is a developer-focused guide to writing applications using Spring Boot. In it, you'll learn how to bypass configuration steps so you can focus on your application's behavior. Spring expert Craig Walls uses interesting and practical examples to teach you both how to use the default settings effectively and how to override and customize Spring Boot for your unique environment. Along the way, you'll pick up insights from Craig's years of Spring development experience.

    "description": "While the architecture of present-day parallel supercomputers is largely based on the concept of a shared memory, with its attendant limitations of common access, advances in semicoductor technology have led to the development of highly parellel computer architectures with decentralized storage and limited connections in which each processor possesses high bandwidth local memory connected to a small number of such architectures, enabling cost-effective high-speed parallel processing for large volumes of data, with ultra-high throughput rates. Algorithms suitable for implementation on systolic arrays find applications in areas such as signal and image processing, pattern matching, linear algebra, recurrence algorithms and graph problems. This book provides an insight into the implementation of systolic arrays and gives a comprehensive overview of the techniques and theories contributing to the design of systolic algorithms.",

During that decade, a great number of research contributions in graph theory had been produced, which laid the foundations for most of the research in graph optimization in the following years. During the Seventies, a large number of special purpose models were developed. The impressive growth of this field since has been strongly determined by the demand of applications and influenced by the technological increases in computing power and the availability of data and software. The availability of such basic tools has led to the feasibility of the exact or well approximate solution of large scale realistic combinatorial optimization problems and has created a number of new combinatorial problems.",

    "description": "\"During the last ten years Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC) has established itself as one of the new hot topic fields in physics, with the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and technology. QIPC replaces the laws of classical physics applied to computation and communication with the more fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. This becomes increasingly important due to technological progress going down to smaller and smaller scales where quantum effects start to be dominant. In addition to its fundamental nature, QIPC promises to advance computing power beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, to guarantee secure communication and establish direct links to emerging quantum technologies, such as, for example, quantum based sensors and clocks. One of the outstanding feature of QIPC is its interdisciplinary character: it brings together researchers from physics, mathematics and computer science. In particular, within physics we have seen the emergence of a new QIPC community, which ranges from theoretical to experimental physics, and crosses boundaries of traditionally separated disciplines such as atomic physics, quantum optics, statistical mechanics and solid state physics, all working on different and complementary aspects of QIPC. This publication covers the following topics: Introduction to quantum computing; Quantum logic, information and entanglement; Quantum algorithms; Error-correcting codes for quantum computations; Quantum measurements and control; Quantum communication; Quantum optics and cold atoms for quantum information; Quantum computing with solid state devices; Theory and experiments for superconducting qubits; Interactions in many-body systems: quantum chaos, disorder and random matrices; Decoherence effects for quantum computing; and Flature prospects of quantum information processing.\"",

    "description": "This textbook, for second- or third-year students of computer science, presents insights, notations, and analogies to help them describe and think about algorithms like an expert, without grinding through lots of formal proof. Solutions to many problems are provided to let students check their progress, while class-tested PowerPoint slides are on the web for anyone running the course. By looking at both the big picture and easy step-by-step methods for developing algorithms, the author guides students around the common pitfalls. He stresses paradigms such as loop invariants and recursion to unify a huge range of algorithms into a few meta-algorithms. The book fosters a deeper understanding of how and why each algorithm works.

    "description": "Algorithms specify the way computers process information and how they execute tasks. Many recent technological innovations and achievements rely on algorithmic ideas \u2013 they facilitate new applications in science, medicine, production, logistics, traffic, communi\u00accation and entertainment. Efficient algorithms not only enable your personal computer to execute the newest generation of games with features unimaginable only a few years ago, they are also key to several recent scientific breakthroughs \u2013 for example, the sequencing of the human genome would not have been possible without the invention of new algorithmic ideas that speed up computations by several orders of magnitude. The greatest improvements in the area of algorithms rely on beautiful ideas for tackling computational tasks more efficiently. The problems solved are not restricted to arithmetic tasks in a narrow sense but often relate to exciting questions of nonmathematical flavor, such as: How can I find the exit out of a maze? How can I partition a treasure map so that the treasure can only be found if all parts of the map are recombined? How should I plan my trip to minimize cost? Solving these challenging problems requires logical reasoning, geometric and combinatorial imagination, and, last but not least, creativity \u2013 the skills needed for the design and analysis of algorithms. In this book we present some of the most beautiful algorithmic ideas in 41 articles written in colloquial, nontechnical language. Most of the articles arose out of an initiative among German-language universities to communicate the fascination of algorithms and computer science to high-school students. The book can be understood without any prior knowledge of algorithms and computing, and it will be an enlightening and fun read for students and interested adults.",

If you were accused of a crime, who would you rather decide your sentence\u2014a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and error? What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree to share your family\u2019s full medical history if you were told that it would help researchers find a cure for cancer? These are just some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail. But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important decisions\u2014in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and money\u2014they raise questions about what we want our world to look like. What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing innocent people being falsely accused? Hello World takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms, Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on the human systems they replace.",

A simple web search picks out a handful of relevant needles from the world's biggest haystack: the billions of pages on the World Wide Web. Uploading a photo to Facebook transmits millions of pieces of information over numerous error-prone network links, yet somehow a perfect copy of the photo arrives intact. Without even knowing it, we use public-key cryptography to transmit secret information like credit card numbers; and we use digital signatures to verify the identity of the websites we visit. How do our computers perform these tasks with such ease? This is the first book to answer that question in language anyone can understand, revealing the extraordinary ideas that power our PCs, laptops, and smartphones. Using vivid examples, John MacCormick explains the fundamental \"tricks\" behind nine types of computer algorithms, including artificial intelligence (where we learn about the \"nearest neighbor trick\" and \"twenty questions trick\"), Google's famous PageRank algorithm (which uses the \"random surfer trick\"), data compression, error correction, and much more.

It comprises 18 chapters, including two introductory chapters which address the fundamental issues that have made optimisation problems difficult to solve and explain the rationale for seeking inspiration from nature. The contributions stand out through their novelty and clarity of the algorithmic descriptions and analyses, and lead the way to interesting and varied new applications.",

    "description": "For several years now I have been teaching courses in computer algebra at the Universitat Linz, the University of Delaware, and the Universidad de Alcala de Henares. In the summers of 1990 and 1992 I have organized and taught summer schools in computer algebra at the Universitat Linz. Gradually a set of course notes has emerged from these activities. People have asked me for copies of the course notes, and different versions of them have been circulating for a few years. Finally I decided that I should really take the time to write the material up in a coherent way and make a book out of it. Here, now, is the result of this work. Over the years many students have been helpful in improving the quality of the notes, and also several colleagues at Linz and elsewhere have contributed to it. I want to thank them all for their effort, in particular I want to thank B. Buchberger, who taught me the theory of Grabner bases nearly two decades ago, B. F. Caviness and B. D. Saunders, who first stimulated my interest in various problems in computer algebra, G. E. Collins, who showed me how to compute in algebraic domains, and J. R. Sendra, with whom I started to apply computer algebra methods to problems in algebraic geometry. Several colleagues have suggested improvements in earlier versions of this book. However, I want to make it clear that I am responsible for all remaining mistakes.",

    "description": "Distributed Computing is rapidly becoming the principal computing paradigm in diverse areas of computing, communication, and control. Processor clusters, local and wide area networks, and the information highway evolved a new kind of problems which can be solved with distributed algorithms. In this textbook a variety of distributed algorithms are presented independently of particular programming languages or hardware, using the graphically suggestive technique of Petri nets which is both easy to comprehend intuitively and formally rigorous. By means of temporal logic the author provides surprisingly simple yet powerful correctness proofs for the algorithms. The scope of the book ranges from distributed control and synchronization of two sites up to algorithms on any kind of networks. Numerous examples show that description and analysis of distributed algorithms in this framework are intuitive and technically transparent.",

    "description": "Because of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code. The book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.",

What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.",

Bucket algorithms operate on raw untransformed data which are parti tioned Into groups according to membership In equl-slzed d-dlmenslonal hyperrec tangles, called cells or buckets. The bucket data structure Is rather sensitive to the distribution of the data. In these lecture notes, we attempt to explain the connection between the expected time of various bucket algorithms and the dis tribution of the data. The results are Illustrated on standard searching, sorting and selection problems, as well as on a variety of problems In computational geometry and operations research. The notes grew partially from a graduate course on probability theory In computer science.

INTRODUCTION 1 INTRODUCTION It Is not a secret that methods based upon the truncation of data have good expected time performance. For example, for nice distributions of the data, searching Is often better done via a hashing data structure Instead of via a search tree. The speed one observes In practice Is due to the fact that the truncation operation Is a constant time operation.",

However, as scientists and technical experts, we do have to consider them also from a different perspective: they are naturalphenomena that evolve with time and depend on a number of variables. Their modeling can help us to reply to the simplest and - at the same time - the most complex question: are earthquakes predictable? In case the answer is affirmative, what could be the role of the extremely mature Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in setting up an effective prediction process? How Artificial Intelligence Algorithms can contribute to the picture? The book presents our vision about the above matter. The book is organized in three parts. Part 1 frames the possible use of ICT and Artificial Intelligence in dealing with earthquake-related Disaster Ahead Management (DAM). Part 2 presents modeling tools for the earthquake issue and proposes possible ICT tools for supporting the earthquake DAM. Part 3 presents an experimental network for earthquake DAM based on communications and navigation (GNSS) tools.",

This section is limited to the basic concepts as they apply to other parts of the book. Thus, we have restricted our discussion of number theory to congruences, primitive roots, quadratic residues, and to the properties of Mersenne and Fermat numbers. The section on polynomial algebra deals primarily with the divisibility and congruence properties of polynomials and with algebraic computational complexity. The rest of the book is focused directly on fast digital filtering and discrete Fourier transform algorithms. We have attempted to present these techniques in a unified way by using polynomial algebra as extensively as possible. This objective has led us to reformulate many of the algorithms which are discussed in the book. It has been our experience that such a presentation serves to clarify the relationship between the algorithms and often provides clues to improved computation techniques. Chapter 3 reviews the fast digital filtering algorithms, with emphasis on algebraic methods and on the evaluation of one-dimensional circular convolutions. Chapters 4 and 5 present the fast Fourier transform and the Winograd Fourier transform algorithm.",

Since the difficulty of the factoring problem is crucial for the se curity of a public key encryption system, interest (and funding) in quan tum computing and quantum computation suddenly blossomed. Quan tum computing had arrived. The study of the role of quantum mechanics in the theory of computa tion seems to have begun in the early 1980s with the publications of Paul Benioff [6]' [7] who considered a quantum mechanical model of computers and the computation process. A related question was discussed shortly thereafter by Richard Feynman [35] who began from a different perspec tive by asking what kind of computer should be used to simulate physics. His analysis led him to the belief that with a suitable class of \"quantum machines\" one could imitate any quantum system.",

    "description": "This monograph is a slightly revised version of my PhD thesis [86], com pleted in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Edin burgh in June 1988, with an additional chapter summarising more recent developments. Some of the material has appeared in the form of papers [50,88]. The underlying theme of the monograph is the study of two classical problems: counting the elements of a finite set of combinatorial structures, and generating them uniformly at random. In their exact form, these prob lems appear to be intractable for many important structures, so interest has focused on finding efficient randomised algorithms that solve them ap proxim~ly, with a small probability of error. For most natural structures the two problems are intimately connected at this level of approximation, so it is natural to study them together. At the heart of the monograph is a single algorithmic paradigm: sim ulate a Markov chain whose states are combinatorial structures and which converges to a known probability distribution over them. This technique has applications not only in combinatorial counting and generation, but also in several other areas such as statistical physics and combinatorial optimi sation. The efficiency of the technique in any application depends crucially on the rate of convergence of the Markov chain.",

While there are some success stories such as PlanetLab, OneLab, BOINC, BitTorrent, and SETI@home, a widespread use of these technologies for business applications has not yet been achieved. In a business environment, mechanisms are needed to provide incentives to potential users for participating in such networks. These mechanisms may range from simple non-monetary access rights, monetary payments to specific policies for sharing. Although a few models for a framework have been discussed (in the general area of a \"Grid Economy\"), none of these models has yet been realised in practice. This book attempts to fill this gap by discussing the reasons for such limited take-up and exploring incentive mechanisms for resource sharing in distributed systems.

    "description": "For a long time computer scientists have distinguished between fast and slow algo rithms. Fast (or good) algorithms are the algorithms that run in polynomial time, which means that the number of steps required for the algorithm to solve a problem is bounded by some polynomial in the length of the input. All other algorithms are slow (or bad). The running time of slow algorithms is usually exponential. This book is about bad algorithms. There are several reasons why we are interested in exponential time algorithms. Most of us believe that there are many natural problems which cannot be solved by polynomial time algorithms. The most famous and oldest family of hard problems is the family of NP complete problems. Most likely there are no polynomial time al gorithms solving these hard problems and in the worst case scenario the exponential running time is unavoidable. Every combinatorial problem is solvable in ?nite time by enumerating all possi ble solutions, i. e. by brute force search. But is brute force search always unavoid able? De?nitely not. Already in the nineteen sixties and seventies it was known that some NP complete problems can be solved signi?cantly faster than by brute force search. Three classic examples are the following algorithms for the TRAVELLING SALESMAN problem, MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, and COLORING.",

They play a key role in a variety of research areas, such as combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms, computational complexity, graph theory, geometry, real algebraic geometry and quantum computing. This book is an introduction to selected aspects of semidefinite programming and its use in approximation algorithms. It covers the basics but also a significant amount of recent and more advanced material. There are many computational problems, such as MAXCUT, for which one cannot reasonably expect to obtain an exact solution efficiently, and in such case, one has to settle for approximate solutions. For MAXCUT and its relatives, exciting recent results suggest that semidefinite programming is probably the ultimate tool. Indeed, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, a plausible but as yet unproven hypothesis, it was shown that for these problems, known algorithms based on semidefinite programming deliver the best possible approximation ratios among all polynomial-time algorithms. This book follows the \u201csemidefinite side\u201d of these developments, presenting some of the main ideas behind approximation algorithms based on semidefinite programming. It develops the basic theory of semidefinite programming, presents one of the known efficient algorithms in detail, and describes the principles of some others.

    "description": "The mystique of biologically inspired (or bioinspired) paradigms is their ability to describe and solve complex relationships from intrinsically very simple initial conditions and with little or no knowledge of the search space. Edited by two prominent, well-respected researchers, the Handbook of Bioinspired Algorithms and Applications reveals the connections between bioinspired techniques and the development of solutions to problems that arise in diverse problem domains. A repository of the theory and fundamentals as well as a manual for practical implementation, this authoritative handbook provides broad coverage in a single source along with numerous references to the available literature for more in-depth information. The book's two sections serve to balance coverage of theory and practical applications. The first section explains the fundamentals of techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, cellular automata, and others. Detailed examples and case studies in the second section illustrate how to apply the theory in actually developing solutions to a particular problem based on a bioinspired technique. Emphasizing the importance of understanding and harnessing the robust capabilities of bioinspired techniques for solving computationally intractable optimizations and decision-making applications, the Handbook of Bioinspired Algorithms and Applications is an absolute must-read for anyone who is serious about advancing the next generation of computing.",

    "author": "Pedro Larra\u00f1aga, Jose A Lozano",
    "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms: A New Tool for Evolutionary Computation is devoted to a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, named estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This new class of algorithms generalizes genetic algorithms by replacing the crossover and mutation operators with learning and sampling from the probability distribution of the best individuals of the population at each iteration of the algorithm. Working in such a way, the relationships between the variables involved in the problem domain are explicitly and effectively captured and exploited. This text constitutes the first compilation and review of the techniques and applications of this new tool for performing evolutionary computation. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms: A New Tool for Evolutionary Computation is clearly divided into three parts. Part I is dedicated to the foundations of EDAs. In this part, after introducing some probabilistic graphical models - Bayesian and Gaussian networks - a review of existing EDA approaches is presented, as well as some new methods based on more flexible probabilistic graphical models. A mathematical modeling of discrete EDAs is also presented. Part II covers several applications of EDAs in some classical optimization problems: the travelling salesman problem, the job scheduling problem, and the knapsack problem. EDAs are also applied to the optimization of some well-known combinatorial and continuous functions. Part III presents the application of EDAs to solve some problems that arise in the machine learning field: feature subset selection, feature weighting in K-NN classifiers, rule induction, partial abductive inference in Bayesian networks, partitional clustering, and the search for optimal weights in artificial neural networks. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms: A New Tool for Evolutionary Computation is a useful and interesting tool for researchers working in the field of evolutionary computation and for engineers who face real-world optimization problems. This book may also be used by graduate students and researchers in computer science. `... I urge those who are interested in EDAs to study this well-crafted book today.' David E.

    "author": "Ber\u00e7 Rustem, Melendres Howe",
    "description": "Recognizing that robust decision making is vital in risk management, this book provides concepts and algorithms for computing the best decision in view of the worst-case scenario. The main tool used is minimax, which ensures robust policies with guaranteed optimal performance that will improve further if the worst case is not realized. The applications considered are drawn from finance, but the design and algorithms presented are equally applicable to problems of economic policy, engineering design, and other areas of decision making. Critically, worst-case design addresses not only Armageddon-type uncertainty. Indeed, the determination of the worst case becomes nontrivial when faced with numerous--possibly infinite--and reasonably likely rival scenarios. Optimality does not depend on any single scenario but on all the scenarios under consideration. Worst-case optimal decisions provide guaranteed optimal performance for systems operating within the specified scenario range indicating the uncertainty. The noninferiority of minimax solutions--which also offer the possibility of multiple maxima--ensures this optimality. Worst-case design is not intended to necessarily replace expected value optimization when the underlying uncertainty is stochastic. However, wise decision making requires the justification of policies based on expected value optimization in view of the worst-case scenario. Conversely, the cost of the assured performance provided by robust worst-case decision making needs to be evaluated relative to optimal expected values. Written for postgraduate students and researchers engaged in optimization, engineering design, economics, and finance, this book will also be invaluable to practitioners in risk management.",

    "description": "In Distributed Algorithms, Nancy Lynch provides a blueprint for designing, implementing, and analyzing distributed algorithms. She directs her book at a wide audience, including students, programmers, system designers, and researchers. Distributed Algorithms contains the most significant algorithms and impossibility results in the area, all in a simple automata-theoretic setting. The algorithms are proved correct, and their complexity is analyzed according to precisely defined complexity measures. The problems covered include resource allocation, communication, consensus among distributed processes, data consistency, deadlock detection, leader election, global snapshots, and many others. The material is organized according to the system model\u2014first by the timing model and then by the interprocess communication mechanism. The material on system models is isolated in separate chapters for easy reference. The presentation is completely rigorous, yet is intuitive enough for immediate comprehension. This book familiarizes readers with important problems, algorithms, and impossibility results in the area: readers can then recognize the problems when they arise in practice, apply the algorithms to solve them, and use the impossibility results to determine whether problems are unsolvable. The book also provides readers with the basic mathematical tools for designing new algorithms and proving new impossibility results. In addition, it teaches readers how to reason carefully about distributed algorithms\u2014to model them formally, devise precise specifications for their required behavior, prove their correctness, and evaluate their performance with realistic measures.",

Aided by GAs, analysts and designers now routinely evolve solutions to complex combinatorial and multiobjective optimization problems with an ease and rapidity unthinkable withconventional methods. Despite the continued growth and refinement of this powerful analytical tool, there continues to be a lack of up-to-date guides to contemporary GA optimization principles and practices. Written by two of the world's leading experts in the field, this book fills that gap in the literature. Taking an intuitive approach, Mitsuo Gen and Runwei Cheng employ numerous illustrations and real-world examples to help readers gain a thorough understanding of basic GA concepts-including encoding, adaptation, and genetic optimizations-and to show how GAs can be used to solve an array of constrained, combinatorial, multiobjective, and fuzzy optimization problems. Focusing on problems commonly encountered in industry-especially in manufacturing-Professors Gen and Cheng provide in-depth coverage of advanced GA techniques for: * Reliability design * Manufacturing cell design * Scheduling * Advanced transportation problems * Network design and routing Genetic Algorithms and Engineering Optimization is an indispensable working resource for industrial engineers and designers, as well as systems analysts, operations researchers, and management scientists working in manufacturing and related industries.

    "description": "This book is your indispensable guide to cutting-edge CSS development\u2014all you need to work your way up to CSS professional. While CSS is a relatively simple technology to learn, it is a difficult one to master. When you first start developing sites using CSS, you will come across all kinds of infuriating browser bugs and inconsistencies. It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve. By bringing all of the latest tips, tricks, and techniques together in one handy reference, this book demystifies the secrets of CSS and makes the journey to CSS mastery as simple and painless as possible. While most books concentrate on basic skills, this one is different, assuming that you already know the basics and why you should be using CSS in your work, and concentrating mainly on advanced techniques. It begins with a brief recap of CSS fundamentals such as the importance of meaningful markup, how to structure and maintain your code, and how the CSS layout model really works. With the basics out of the way, each subsequent chapter details a particular aspect of CSS-based design. Through a series of easy-to-follow tutorials, you will learn practical CSS techniques you can immediately start using in your daily work. Browser inconsistencies are the thorn in most CSS developers' sides, so we have dedicated two whole chapters to CSS hacks, filters, and bug fixing, as well as looking at image replacement; professional link, form, and list styling; pure CSS layouts; and much more. All of these techniques are then put into practice in two beautifully designed case studies, written by two of the world's best CSS designers, Simon Collison and Cameron Moll.",

    "author": "Keith Schengili-Roberts",
    "description": "Preface Welcome to the second edition of Core CSS. When the initial edition came out in 2000, while CSS had been around for a few years, it was largely underutilized on the Web. And there was a good reason for this: browser support for CSS properties was, to put it kindly, \"spotty.\" In the past few years things have changed substantially: the Mozilla project pushed for a standards-compliant rendering engine\u2014including CSS\u2014that has since been incorporated into the most recent versions of Netscape Navigator; and Internet Explorer 5.0 and later 6.0 made real advances in supporting CSS properties. As older, non-CSS-compliant browsers fade into the background, Web design has advanced accordingly and is beginning to take full advantage of the formatting possibilities that CSS opens up for both eye-popping and better functioning Web sites. While the browser manufacturers have been playing \"catch-up\" and have largely (with some notable exceptions) instituted the CSS1 and CSS2 standards devised by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the W3C has not stood still. While still in draft status, the various modules that will one day comprise the CSS3 specification are well on the way towards providing a comprehensive set of tools for Web authors seeking to format just about anything and everything you can think of that has to do with a Web page. While none of these CSS3 modules have been finalized\u2014and things may still change substantially\u2014many of the new directions that are being charted by the W3C in this area are covered in this book as a \"heads up\" as to what future Web developers can come to expect. One of the original reasons behind the creation of CSS was to prevent competing browsers developers from the runaway development of new HTML tags that only worked in their particular browser. This has seemingly not stopped the temptation by browser manufacturers to continue to \"push the envelope,\" and in particular, recent versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer have included a number of browser-specific CSS properties. These are covered in the various sections of the book, both out of a sense of completeness as well as wanting to provide readers who may be working in a \"closed-shop\" environment (i.e., where they know that their clients are all using this browser) with information they can genuinely use. As a member of the W3C, Microsoft is also helping to chart the progress of the future CSS development, and many as yet browser-specific CSS properties may not be so in the future. When I am asked why I write computer books, I usually respond that I write books I wished already existed that I could use daily in my work. A number of books have appeared since the first edition of Core CSS came out, but none of them have been as comprehensive\u2014especially when it came to covering CSS2 or Internet Explorer properties\u2014as I would have liked. The majority of the code in the first book has been completely re-written for this edition, and dozens more examples better show what particular CSS properties can do and how they work\u2014or do not work\u2014in modern browsers. Who You Are You are a Web author who is looking to expand the capabilities of your Web pages. You know that CSS opens the doors to a wide range of possibilities, but want to learn more about how to make the most of it. Or perhaps you know that CSS will solve some of your most pernicious Web formatting problems, but shy away from using it because you have heard that it can produce varying results when viewed under different browsers or under different operating systems. Maybe you are looking for a single source that tells you what you need to know about a property at a glance, instead of having to traverse a dozen Web sites to get the same information. If you fit any of these circumstances, then this book is for you. This book takes a practical, pragmatic look at the current state of affairs regarding CSS and guides the reader through how CSS works. This book provides the information Web authors need in order to understand not only how CSS should work, but also how it actually works in current major browsers. It does not confine itself only to one operating system, but takes a look at how CSS works under browsers working under multiple operating systems. With this knowledge, Web authors will know which CSS properties are \"safe\" for use, and which to avoid. More than that though, this book also provides information as to the future of CSS with an in-depth look at what will likely prove to be the foundation of the future CSS3 specification. You do not have to be an expert at understanding how Web pages work, but the book does assume you have a basic understanding of both HTML and the Web. The book assumes no prior knowledge of CSS. It will not only serve those Web authors who are just starting out using CSS, but also act as a handy reference for those occasions when you need to look up how a particular CSS property works. How This Book Is Organized The first edition of this book separated CSS1 and CSS2 properties. Now that much of CSS2 has been adopted within the major browsers, it no longer made sense to keep things separate. This has been extended further to include draft CSS3 properties into the (sometimes rough) families of properties to which they belong. While these properties are not currently in use\u2014and some of them may not end up looking the same as they do in this book when they are finally released\u2014they are important as an indicator of the way CSS development is progressing, so that forwardlooking Web authors can get a heads up. The CSS3 properties outlined here are my \"best guesses\" based on my own Web-authoring experience. In some cases there are wholly separate chapters devoted to Internet Explorer-only CSS properties, but many of them fall into already-defined families of properties and are included in those chapters. In addition to all of the chapters in this book are some appendices designed to provide the Web author with quick reference material to have on hand when writing CSS code. Chapter 1 (\"The Birth of CSS\") explores how CSS in its current form came to be. The following two chapters (Chapter 2, \"(X)HTML and Its Relationship to CSS\" and Chapter 3, \"Browser Adoption of CSS\") provide information on how CSS can be accessed within Web page code, and how the major browser manufacturers have increasingly adopted CSS within their browsers. Chapter 4 (\"Implementation of Basic CSS Concepts\") looks at how some of the basic concepts behind CSS\u2014such as inheritance, grouping CSS code and cascading rules\u2014are implemented in the major browsers. Chapters 5 and 6 (\"The Cascade\" and \"CSS Units,\" respectively) extend this concept further by looking at how the \"C\" of \"CSS\" works, and explains the many different fundamental units of measure that can be used in conjunction with certain CSS properties. Chapter 7 (\"Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements\") looks at how these CSS elements which allow for special or conditional types of formatting can be utilized. Chapter 8 (\"Media Types and Media Queries\") introduces the concept of media types and examines how Web pages can be modified so that they can be displayed through such things as print or \"talking browsers.\" Chapters 9 and 10 (\"Font Properties\" and \"Text Properties\") begin the \"meat and potatoes\" part of the book for most readers, looking in detail at the properties used daily by an increasing number of Web authors. Chapter 11 (\"Text Property Extensions\") is the first chapter devoted wholly to Internet Explorer-specific properties, most of which are aimed at formatting Web pages for an international audience. Chapter 12 (\"Box Properties\") brings us back to the \"meat and potatoes\" area of CSS formatting, explaining in detail the box set CSS properties, which can determine how a wide variety of Web elements such as headers, images and paragraphs can be enhanced. The topic of Chapter 13 (\"Color\") used to be part of the background family of properties, but the draft CSS3 module has charted a new course for using color on the Web, all of which is looked at in this section. Background properties\u2014including a number of draft CSS innovations in this area\u2014are covered in Chapter 14 (\"Background Properties\"). Chapter 15 (\"Classification Properties and Generated/Automatic Content\") is the start of what for many readers will be the more esoteric uses to which CSS can be put to, and yet represents much of where the real rendering power behind CSS lies. This chapter looks at how its functions enable Web authors to control and enhance content that is automatically generated by the browser, including such things as the numbering and display of lists. Chapter 16 (\"Visual Formatting and Detailed Visual Formatting\") represents the core of what is popularly known as the \"CSS positioning\" properties. Chapter 17 (\"Visual Effects\") looks primarily at properties designed to produce stunning effects using dynamic code. Chapter 18 (\"Paged Media\") explores those properties related to crafting Web pages so that they can be printed (rather than displayed on a screen) in the precise way that a Web author desires. Chapter 19 (\"Tables\") looks at the somewhat rag-tag collection of table-related formatting properties, but then rounds off the chapter by looking at ways of creating table-like formatting structures using only CSS. In addition to covering what is already possible to do with user-interface properties in Chapter 20 (\"User Interface\")\u2014such as providing greater control over the display of such things as cursors and the outlines that surround buttons or text fields in forms that denote a \"focus\" for user input\u2014it also includes an extensive preview as to how you can affect the functionality of Web pages when now-draft CSS3 properties become available. Mastering the properties covered in these sections guarantees that you will be at the forefront of CSS-based Web design. Chapter 21 (\"Aural Cascading Style Sheets\") begins a section of the book covering either under-implemented CSS properties or those specific to working with a particular browser. This chapter explores a relatively new class of properties designed to enable the Web author to determine how a Web page could be spoken aloud by a browser with speech capabilities\u2014sadly, this is poorly implemented in the major browsers. Chapter 22 (\"Ruby\") looks at the properties used in formatting a particular type of Chinese text layout; these properties are specific to Internet Explorer but are now being actively considered by the W3C for inclusion in the future CSS3 specification. Columnar layout properties, based in part on some old browser-specific HTML tags in Netscape Navigator, are explored in Chapter 23 (\"Multi-Column Layout\"). Chapter 24 (\"Scrollbars\") briefly looks at some properties designed to change the appearance of scrollbars specific to recent versions of Internet Explorer. The final chapter (Chapter 25 \"Filters and Transitions\") is a sizable one devoted to Internet Explorer's CSS-based way of adding some interesting and often dynamic visual effects. Appendix A is a CSS compatibility chart, looking at all of the \"Safe,\" \"Unsafe\" and \"Partial\"-ly implemented CSS1 and CSS2 properties for various versions of the browsers Web authors are likely to run into. Appendix B provides an alphabetical listing of all CSS1, CSS2 and Internet Explorer CSS properties (minus the admittedly oddball filter and transition properties) as a quick reference. Appendix C looks at the CSS3 Mobile Profile and contains properties that are expected to be implemented in scaled-down browsers intended for use while \"on the go.\"",

    "description": "Sometimes it's hard to get started with a new technology. That's where this book excels. It's not going to show Web designers everything there is to know about CSS but rather will provide a solid introduction from which to build their CSS knowledge. The beginning of the book starts with the basics -- rules, selectors, classes, IDs, the cascade, internal and external style sheets, Divs, boxes, floats, padding, margins -- everything is covered. Next comes styling elements, working with images, menus and navigation, and moving styles from internal to external style sheets. Rounding out this project-based guide is working with browsers, both old and new, and debugging CSS. Succinct and to the point, it's the perfect book for designers without a lot of time who need to understand and start using CSS.",

This book will help you understand HTML's syntax and semantics, which will allow you to create a website completely from scratch. We'll teach you how to lay down the foundations\u2014the backbone\u2014of a website and then add aesthetic elements later on using Cascading Style Sheets or what's commonly known as CSS.

And, knowing the basics of CSS is an essential ingredient for success. CSS for Print Designers presents web design concepts using metaphors that make sense to visual designers. Instead of using terms like semantics and structure, the book simplifies the language of web design using metaphors that print designers are comfortable with such as grouping like items or sculpting a layout from top to bottom or even how using sprites with CSS is like importing and cropping images in InDesign.

    "publisher": "Wrox",
    "author": "Richard York",
    "description": "This book covers the jQuery JavaScript framework and the jQuery UI JavaScript framework to get more results more quickly out of JavaScript programming. I cover each method exposed by jQuery\u2019s API, which contains methods to make common, redundant tasks go much more quickly in less code. I also cover how jQuery eliminates certain cross-browser, cross-platform development headaches like the event model; not only does it eliminate these headaches, but it also makes it easier to work with events by reducing the amount of code that you need to write to attach events. It even gives you the ability to simulate events. You should have a basic understanding of JavaScript. I review some basic JavaScript programming concepts, such as the Event API, but I do not go into great detail about the JavaScript language itself. You\u2019ll want to have at least a basic grasp of the Document Object Model, or DOM, and basic JavaScript programming syntax. Additionally, you\u2019ll need to know your way around CSS and HTML, since knowledge of those technologies is also assumed. You\u2019ll see how you can leverage the jQuery UI library to make graphically driven UI widgets. jQuery gives you the ability to break content up among multiple tabs in the same page. You have the ability to customize the look and feel of the tabs, and even to create a polished look and feel by providing different effects that come in when you mouse over tabs and click on them. Some of the UI elements and techniques include: make any element draggable with the mouse drag-and-drop user interfaces lists that are sortable via drag-and-drop re-size elements on a page using the mouse entering a date into a field using a nice, accessible JavaScript-driven calendar that pops up when you click on an input field custom pop-up dialogues that are like virtual pop-up windows a graphical slider bar, similar to your media player\u2019s volume control",

    "author": "Chris Pitt",
    "description": "Model View Controller (MVC) is becoming the definitive architecture of website development frameworks due to the stability, extensibility and predictability it lends to development. It is not just the primary separation of database, business logic and interface components, but includes a wide range of considerations for building high-performing, scalable and secure applications. Deciding which MVC framework best suits the project you are about to begin is one of the biggest challenges you'll face as a developer. If you are part of a team, this decision has probably already been made for you; but in any event, you'll need to know how (and why) the framework authors made it work the way it does. Pro PHP MVC looks at the building blocks that make any good MVC framework, and how they apply to PHP. It exposes all considerations that many developers take for granted when using a popular framework, and teaches you how to make the framework your own. Over the course of reading this book, you will learn the theoretical implications of the choices you would make when writing your own MVC framework, and how to put the pieces together in a cohesive package. We take a look at the highly modular Zend Framework\u2014how to use its collection of loosely coupled classes to build a unified system. We also look at CakePHP, learning from its automated build system (Bakery) and highly intuitive approach to rapid development. This book will lay bare all the secret parts of MVC for you. What you\u2019ll learn The best way to structure your application files How to get from a URL to the right controller/action Cleanly interact with data objects Efficient use of server resources in content delivery Useful shared class libraries to speed up development Unit testing to ensure maximum stability Who this book is for This book is for beginners and advanced developers alike, requiring a basic understanding of PHP5 language features and SQL. If you want to improve your PHP skills, or share the wisdom of popular PHP MVC frameworks, this book will be invaluable to you.",

Securing PHP Web Applications will help you master the specific techniques, skills, and best practices you need to write rock-solid PHP code and harden the PHP software you\u2019re already using. Drawing on more than fifteen years of experience in Web development, security, and training, Tricia and William Ballad show how security flaws can find their way into PHP code, and they identify the most common security mistakes made by PHP developers. The authors present practical, specific solutions\u2014techniques that are surprisingly easy to understand and use, no matter what level of PHP programming expertise you have. Securing PHP Web Applications covers the most important aspects of PHP code security, from error handling and buffer overflows to input validation and filesystem access. The authors explode the myths that discourage PHP programmers from attempting to secure their code and teach you how to instinctively write more secure code without compromising your software\u2019s performance or your own productivity. Coverage includes Designing secure applications from the very beginning\u2014and plugging holes in applications you can\u2019t rewrite from scratch Defending against session hijacking, fixation, and poisoning attacks that PHP can\u2019t resist on its own Securing the servers your PHP code runs on, including specific guidance for Apache, MySQL, IIS/SQL Server, and more Enforcing strict authentication and making the most of encryption Preventing dangerous cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks Systematically testing yourapplications for security, including detailed discussions of exploit testing and PHP test automation Addressing known vulnerabilities in the third-party applications you\u2019re already running Tricia and William Ballad demystify PHP security by presenting realistic scenarios and code examples, practical checklists, detailed visuals, and more.

In this book, author Daniel Howard demonstrates the remarkable similarities between the two languages, and shows you how to port your entire PHP web application to Node.js. By comparing specific PHP features with their Node counterparts, you\u2019ll also discover how to refactor and improve existing PHP 4 or PHP 5 source code. At the end, you\u2019ll have two fully functional codebases to provide to your users. You can update both of them simultaneously, using this book as a reference to important aspects of PHP and Node.js. Use a simple Node.js framework to convert individual PHP pages to Node.js files Refactor blocking PHP source code to non-blocking Node.js source code that uses callbacks Convert PHP syntax, variables, and types to Node.js Use a step-by-step technique for implementing PHP classes and class inheritance in Node.js Convert PHP file handling APIs into their Node.js equivalents Compare approaches for using a MySQL database in Node.js and PHP Convert PHP code for JSON or XML APIs into Node.js code for npm packages",

    "description": "Make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. David Powers has updated his definitive book to incorporate the latest techniques and changes to PHP, including the arrival of PHP 7. New features include the spaceship and null coalesce operators, generators, using array shorthand syntax for list(), array dereferencing, and array unpacking with the splat operator. The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages. This book also covers MariaDB, a seamless replacement for MySQL that has been adopted on many web servers. Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design. But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or\u2014if you prefer to leave that task to others\u2014to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices. What You Will Learn Design and build dynamic PHP-based web sites and applications Get started right away through practical examples that you can reuse Incorporate PHP 7 elements including new ways of handling arrays Work with the latest PHP 7 techniques, innovations, and best practices Who This Book Is For Readers should have at least some prior exposure to web development using PHP.",

    "description": "If you are a Python programmer who wants to incorporate XML into your skill set, this is the book for you. Python has attracted a wide variety of developers, who use it either as glue to connect critical programming tasks together, or as a complete cross-platform application development language. Yet, because it is object-oriented and has powerful text manipulation abilities, Python is an ideal language for manipulating XML.Python & XML gives you a solid foundation for using these two languages together. Loaded with practical examples, this new volume highlights common application tasks, so that you can learn by doing. The book starts with the basics then quickly progresses to complex topics, like transforming XML with XSLT, querying XML with XPath, and working with XML dialects and validation. It also explores the more advanced issues: using Python with SOAP and distributed web services, and using Python to create scalable streams between distributed applications (like databases and web servers).The book provides effective practical applications, while referencing many of the tools involved in XML processing and Python, and highlights cross-platform issues along with tasks relevant to enterprise computing. You will find ample coverage of XML flow analysis and details on ways in which you can transport XML through your network.Whether you are using Python as an application language, or as an administrative or middleware scripting language, you are sure to benefit from this book. If you want to use Python to manipulate XML, this is your guide.",

    "description": "Every day, we use our computers to perform remarkable feats. A simple web search picks out a handful of relevant needles from the world's biggest haystack: the billions of pages on the World Wide Web. Uploading a photo to Facebook transmits millions of pieces of information over numerous error-prone network links, yet somehow a perfect copy of the photo arrives intact. Without even knowing it, we use public-key cryptography to transmit secret information like credit card numbers; and we use digital signatures to verify the identity of the websites we visit. How do our computers perform these tasks with such ease? This is the first book to answer that question in language anyone can understand, revealing the extraordinary ideas that power our PCs, laptops, and smartphones. Using vivid examples, John MacCormick explains the fundamental \"tricks\" behind nine types of computer algorithms, including artificial intelligence (where we learn about the \"nearest neighbor trick\" and \"twenty questions trick\"), Google's famous PageRank algorithm (which uses the \"random surfer trick\"), data compression, error correction, and much more. These revolutionary algorithms have changed our world: this book unlocks their secrets, and lays bare the incredible ideas that our computers use every day.",

In Which the True Systems of Morality and Civil Government are Established; and the Different Sentiments of Grotius, Hobbes, Puffendorf, Barbeyrac, Locke, Clark, and Hutchinson, occasionally considered. Translated into English by Mr. Nugent. London: J. Nourse, 1748. xlii, 312 pp. Reprinted 2004 by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. ISBN 1-58477-295-6.Cloth. $95. * Burlamaqui [1694-1748], a Swiss jurist and professor of civil and natural law at Geneva, outlined a constitutional system based on principles similar to those of the American founding fathers. \"Burlamaqui formulated the principles of popular sovereignty, of delegated power, of a constitution as a fundamental law, of a personal and functional separation of powers into three independent departments... and finally, he provided for an institutional guardian of the fundamental law\" (Harvey). Burlamaqui's other great achievement was to put Pufendorf's theories into systematic form. Marvin stated a general opinion when he observed that \"his works are deservedly held in high esteem.\" Blackstone was one of many jurists influenced by Burlamaqui's work. The sequel, The Principles of Politic Law is also published by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. Marvin, Legal Bibliography (1847) 162.
